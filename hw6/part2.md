Part 2

1- The fetch API is a promise based API
    a- It replace the functionalities of XMLHTTPRequest(XHR)
    b- It provides an interface for fetching resources from all over the web

2- A javascript promise is an object tht represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

3- Developers like using fetch API because of the simplicity while in conjunction with the promise chaining. Flexibility and power are two reasons why fetch API is widely preferred by developers.

4- Fetch API is completely based on promise.

5-  Regular name function syntax
    function func_name() {
        //code to be executed
    }

6- The declaration of a regular name function begins with the keyword "function"

7- It is followed by the name of the function

8- Function names can contain letters, numbers( cannot be at beginning), underscores and $ symbol.

9- The promise chaining is represented by the .then() blocks

10- We use arrows so that objects can be passed from one .then() to another

11- The GeoLocation API allows the user to provide their location to web applications if they so desire

12- To be able to use GeoLocation API, applications must add the GeoLocation  permission property to their code. It ask the user to give permission before accessing their location. 

13- The user device prompt the user to allow location access

14- The .getCurrentPosition() method allow us to get the user's location by longitude and latitude.
